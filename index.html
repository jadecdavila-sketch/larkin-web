        <p>You remember the birthdays. You pack the lunches. You sign the permission slips, buy the teacher gifts, manage the schedules that live entirely in your head. You're holding the entire operation together, and you're doing it on three hours of sleep and cold coffee.</p>
        <p>The invisible load is real. It isn't just remembering—it's the 47 browser tabs of decision fatigue that come after. And nobody's checking if you're okay.</p>
        <p class="hero-highlight">Until now.</p>

      <h2>A Day with Larkin</h2>
      <p class="section-intro">Larkin anticipates what matters, lightens the mental load, and helps life run beautifully—so you actually have space for what keeps getting pushed to "someday": that figure drawing class, the writing project gathering dust, slow mornings by the pond with the kids, creative work that lights you up, walks in the woods that aren't errands in disguise.</p>

            <p class="message">"Soccer practice moved to 4:30. Calendar's updated. This wasn't your fault."</p>

      <h2>Privacy and Consent, by Design</h2>
      <p class="privacy-intro">Larkin never assumes. Never acts without your approval. Never makes you feel managed.</p>

      <ul class="privacy-list">
        <li><strong>You choose what to connect:</strong> Calendar, email, shopping—each is optional and transparent.</li>
        <li><strong>Larkin prepares; you approve.</strong> Someone competent drafts the plan so you can make actual decisions instead of starting from scratch while making dinner.</li>
        <li><strong>Your data stays private and secure.</strong> We're not selling your information or training AI on your kid's soccer schedule.</li>
        <li><strong>You can pause, edit, or delete anything, anytime.</strong> Larkin will always explain why something's being suggested—no mysterious algorithms, no "just trust us."</li>
