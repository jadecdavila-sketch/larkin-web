Yes, it requires attention — stirring, adding broth slowly — but that's part of its appeal. <strong>This is cooking as meditation.</strong> The mushrooms here bring an earthy depth, almost meaty, grounding the creaminess of the rice. This is the kind of meal that asks you to slow down, and rewards you for it.</p>

                <h4>Ingredients</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>6 cups vegetable broth (keep warm in a pot)</li>
                  <li>3 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
                  <li>1 lb mixed mushrooms (cremini, shiitake, oyster), sliced</li>
                  <li>1 small onion, finely diced</li>
                  <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                  <li>1&frac12; cups Arborio rice</li>
                  <li>&frac12; cup dry white wine</li>
                  <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
                  <li>&frac12; cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
                  <li>2 tablespoons fresh thyme leaves</li>
                  <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
                  <li>Fresh parsley for serving</li>

                <h4>Instructions</h4>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Cook the Mushrooms</strong>
                    <p>Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large, wide pan over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms in a single layer (work in batches if needed). Let them cook undisturbed for 3-4 minutes until golden brown on one side, then stir and cook another 2-3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, then transfer to a bowl.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Toast the Rice</strong>
                    <p>In the same pan, add the remaining tablespoon of olive oil. Add the onion and cook until soft, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute. Add the Arborio rice and stir to coat in the oil. Let it toast for 2 minutes until the edges become slightly translucent. This step builds flavor — don't skip it.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Build the Risotto</strong>
                    <p>Pour in the white wine and stir until it's mostly absorbed. Now begin adding the warm broth, one ladleful at a time. Stir frequently and wait until each addition is mostly absorbed before adding the next.</p>
                    <p class="recipe-mindfulness-inline">This process takes about 25-30 minutes. You'll find a rhythm here — stir, wait, add, stir. Let your mind settle into it.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Finish and Serve</strong>
                    <p>When the rice is tender but still has a slight bite, remove from heat. Stir in the butter, Parmesan, thyme, and the cooked mushrooms. The risotto should flow on the plate, not sit in a mound. Divide among shallow bowls. Finish with fresh parsley and extra Parmesan.</p>
                    <p class="recipe-mindfulness-inline">This is comfort — earthy, creamy, deeply satisfying.</p>

                <h5>On Thyme</h5>
                <p>Thyme's botanical name, <em>Thymus</em>, comes from the Greek word for courage. Ancient Romans bathed in thyme water before battle. Today, it's known for supporting respiratory health and bringing calm. In this risotto, it adds a subtle earthiness that complements the mushrooms beautifully.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="larkin-note-section">
                <h5>On Mindful Cooking</h5>
                <p class="recipe-mindfulness">Risotto is one of cooking's great meditations. The stirring, the waiting, the slow transformation of rice into something creamy and luxurious — this is presence in motion. Let yourself settle into the rhythm. There's nowhere to rush to.</p>

                    <p>While the asparagus roasts, pat the salmon fillets dry and season with salt and pepper on both sides. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place salmon skin-side down and press gently with a spatula for 30 seconds to ensure even contact. Cook undisturbed for 4-5 minutes until the skin is crispy.</p>
                    <p>Flip carefully and cook for another 2-3 minutes. The salmon should be opaque on the outside but still slightly translucent in the center. Remove to a plate and tent with foil.</p>

                    <p>Add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds. Remove from heat and stir in lemon juice, capers, and parsley.</p>

                <h5>On Brown Butter</h5>
                <p>Brown butter is one of cooking's small miracles — ordinary butter transformed by heat into something deeply nutty and rich. The French call it <em>beurre noisette</em> (hazelnut butter) for its toasted, almost sweet flavor. It's worth the few extra minutes.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="larkin-note-section">
                <h5>On Mindful Cooking</h5>
                <p class="recipe-mindfulness">As the butter browns, stay present. Watch it shift from yellow to golden to amber. This is cooking as attention — not rushing, just noticing.</p>

                  <li><strong>Make it lighter:</strong> Skip the brown butter and use lemon and herbs only (still delicious, just simpler)</li>

The sweetness of the apples balances the richness of the pork, and the sage brings everything together with its earthy, slightly peppery warmth. <strong>This is autumn on a plate</strong>, but it works year-round when you need something comforting and quick.</p>

                  <li>
                    <strong>Sear the Pork Chops</strong>
                    <p>Pat the pork chops dry and season both sides generously with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook undisturbed for 4-5 minutes until deeply golden on the bottom. Flip and cook another 4-5 minutes until the internal temperature reaches 145&deg;F. Transfer to a plate and tent with foil to rest.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Cook the Apples and Sage</strong>
                    <p>In the same skillet (don't wipe it out — those browned bits are flavor), reduce heat to medium and add the butter. Once melted, add the apple slices in a single layer. Cook for 3-4 minutes on one side until golden, then flip and cook another 2-3 minutes.</p>
                    <p>Add the sage leaves and let them crisp in the butter for 30 seconds. The sage will become fragrant and slightly darker.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Make the Pan Sauce</strong>
                    <p>Add the apple cider vinegar, honey, and a pinch of salt. Stir to combine, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Let it bubble for 1-2 minutes until slightly thickened.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Serve</strong>
                    <p>Return the pork chops to the skillet along with any resting juices. Spoon the apples and sauce over the top. Serve immediately.</p>
                    <p class="recipe-mindfulness-inline">This is dinner — sweet, savory, grounding.</p>

                <h5>On Sage</h5>
                <p>Sage's Latin name, <em>Salvia</em>, means "to save" or "to heal." It's been used for centuries to support digestion, memory, and clarity. When fried in butter, sage becomes crispy and intensely aromatic — one of cooking's small pleasures. This is the kind of ingredient that transforms a dish from good to memorable.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="larkin-note-section">
                <h5>On Mindful Cooking</h5>
                <p class="recipe-mindfulness">As you slice the apples, notice their color — some green, some red, some mottled with both. As they cook, watch them soften and caramelize. This is where attention becomes nourishment.</p>
